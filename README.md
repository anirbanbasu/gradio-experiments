# gradio-experiments

A collection of feature experiments with Gradio.

## Installation and use

Create a Python virtual environment for Python 3.12.0 or above. In that virtual environment, run `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`. Once all the packages are installed, you can start the Gradio server by running `python src/app.py`. If the server is able to start without any problem, it will be listening to port 7860. You will be able to see the web interface on your localhost at http://127.0.0.1:7860/.

Alternatively, you may be able to use a publicly deployed version, such as on Huggingface Spaces.
