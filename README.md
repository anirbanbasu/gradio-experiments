# gradio-experiments

A collection of feature experiments with Gradio.

## Environment variables

You can specify the following environment variables in a `.env`, for example. In addition to those, [Gradio environment variables](https://www.gradio.app/guides/environment-variables) can also be specified but `GRADIO_SERVER_NAME` (set to "0.0.0.0"), `GRADIO_SHARE` (set to False) and `GRADIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` (set to False) will be ignored.


| Variable       | Default value | Description             |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| LOCAL_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY    | None | If you want to be able read from previously saved local storage on the browser, you must specify this environment variable. If it is not specified, a new value is generated for a browser session. |

## Installation and use

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Then, run `uv sync` (with the `--all-groups` flag to install developer and test dependencies). Once dependencies are installed, you can start the Gradio server by running `uv run gre` or `uv run python src/gradio_experiments/app.py`. If the server is able to start without any problem, it will be listening to port 7860 on any IP address of your network adapter. You will be able to see the web interface on your localhost at http://127.0.0.1:7860/.

A public deployment may be available through Huggingface Spaces at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/anirbanbasu/gradio-experiments.
